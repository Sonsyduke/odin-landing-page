# odin-landing-page
This is a landing page project for The Odin Project to practice Flexbox

In this project we'll be creating a simple landing page using the Flexbox.

I decided to create a simple landing page of my favorite anime character, Itachi Uchiha.

In this project I used Flexbox to place all the elements on the correct places.
